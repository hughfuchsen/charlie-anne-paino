      My sight zips around a cool grey corner

      in a hurry to meet a circular window.
      
      Its metallic reflections are untainted
      
      by the pooling array within its hold.
      
      The colours, like magnetic sand,
      
      shift their weights together—
      
      and as though my chest were attached,
      
      I begin twisting inside,
      
      just the calming same.
      
      My vision has its own character,
      
      its own excitement,
      
      its own mission.
      
      When it flies from me,
      
      I hear it panting—
      
      like it’s consuming more of the air around me
      
      than I ever could,
      
      because it can taste freedom
      
      more than I ever could.
